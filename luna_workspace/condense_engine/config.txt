*   database type = <RAM|FILE|H2|PERST|EXTREMEDB|ORIGODB|AEROSPIKE|BLANKDB>
*       How should the database be stored? RAM keeps everything in memory
*       as Java objects; FILE stores everything in binary files. Other possible
*       DBMSs, which may not be implemented yet: H2, Perst, ExtremeDB, Aerospike,
*       OrigoDB, and a BlankDB.

* Output images:
*
*   image start = n
*   image end = n
*     Create an image using the stored pixels between (and
*     including) these two time indexes. For instance, if the first
*     day of data in the database is June 1, and the last day is June
*     30, using imagestart = 0 and imageend = 2 will generate an
*     image using the stored pixels for June 1, 2 and 3 (timestamps
*     are indexed from zero).
