* Example configuration file for Condensate program
*
* Lines starting with "*", "#", or ";" are treated as comments.
* Blank lines are ignored.
*
* Lines don't have to be in any particular order.
*
* If a data line is missing, the program may use defaults.
*
* If a data line is not understood, the program will continue
* but print out a warning.
*
* Text case and spacing is ignored. For instance:
*   "start year = 2013" is the same thing as "STARTYEAR=2013"
*
* Listed below are the possible options, with some explanations. Possible
* command options are shown in <angle> brackets.
* 
*
* To choose the range of processing dates:
*   start year = yyyy
*   start month = mm
*   start day = dd
*   final year = yyyy
*   final month = mm
*   final day = dd
*
* To specify the directories of the I/O and type of data to use:
*   
*   datatype = <none|sea_ice>
*   datapath = text
*     The text string is the full directory path of the data files,
*     with a closing slash.
*   outputPath = text
*     The full output path, with a closing slash, for any data files and images.
*   addyear = <true|false>
*     Add the year to the file path?
*   frequency = nn
*     For SSMI data, what frequency to use (ignored for other types of data)
*   polarization = <h|v>
*     For SSMI data, the polarization
*   surfacefile = text
*     If you want to read the surface type image, this option specifies
*     the full path and filename of the file.
*   surfacelats = text
*   surfacelons = text
*     The surface type file uses separate files for the data's lats and lons.
*     These path+file names specify where to find those files.
*
* Processing control:
*
*   timeincrement = <weekly|monthly|yearly|seasonal>
*   algorithm = <no_condensation|temporal|minmax>
*   threshold = ff.fff
*     The threshold is the standard deviations above and below the mean.
*     The mean is calculated across the time increment. 
*   debug = <true|false>
*     Turns debugging messages on or off. The default is off.
*   warnings = <true|false>
*   readSurface = <true|false>
*     Read the surface type file?
*   writetext = <true|false>
*     This option forces the resulting databse to be output
*     as a plain text file. This is handy for debugging but
*     can also take a lot of time.
*   writebinary = <true|false>
*     Writes the database out as a binary finally. Potentially,
*     this file can be read back in to the program (rather than
*     processing the input data files). The binary is also much
*     more conpact than the text file.
*   image start = n
*   image end = n
*     When an image is generated, use the stored pixels between (and
*     including) these two time indexes (the nth timestamps in the
*     the database, not the index IDs in the database).
